# SU-CPP-Projects
Assorted C++ projects done with Stanford's C++ library. All projects require library & additional files to demonstrate/test, so unfortunately not fully functioning given only the cpp and header files. 

# soundex
"Soundex was patented by Margaret O'Dell and Robert C. Russell in 1918, and the U.S. Census is a big consumer of Soundex along with genealogical researchers, directory assistance, and background investigators. The Soundex algorithm is a coded index based on the way a name sounds rather than the way it is spelled. Surnames that sound the same but are spelled differently, like "Vaska," "Vasque," and "Vussky," have the same code and are classified together. The Soundex algorithm operates on an input surname and converts the name into its Soundex code. A Soundex code is a four-character string in the form of an initial letter followed by three digits, such as Z452." - information taken from web.stanford.edu (CS106B class site)
